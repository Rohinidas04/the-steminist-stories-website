# the-steminist-stories-website

The STEMinist Stories is dedicated to empowering and inspiring young girls to choose STEM fields by interviewing women in STEM and sharing their success stories.

After interviewing these women in-person or virtually, I edited the recording using iMovie and published the video interview on Youtube. I also created a blog where young individuals who have chosen STEM careers share the event or activity that fueled their interest in STEM and how they have continued to pursue their passion. I self-coded and designed a five-page responsive website with a navigation menu for users to view the blog and video interviews. I used HTML, Javascript, and PHP to create a responsive website with content, and I used CSS for the design layout. The website also includes a contact page for users to ask questions or provide feedback regarding the organization.


Languages and software used: HTML, Javascript, CSS, PHP, iMovie
